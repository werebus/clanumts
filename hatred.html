          <LI><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">What follows is a list of things that we,
            as a clan, hate.&nbsp; It is by no means a comprehensive list, as we
            are adding new things to hate every second of every day.&nbsp; Watch
            out, you may be next.</FONT>&nbsp;
            
            <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF"><B>People who talk about campers:</B>&nbsp;
              You know, before I started playing Quake online, I never heard so
              many people bitching about such a ridiculous thing.&nbsp;
              Look...the truth is that campers never win a level.&nbsp; Just
              rail them and move on.&nbsp; Also, just because you came around
              the corner and see someone near a weapon that hasn't respawned
              doesn't mean they are a camper.&nbsp; Did you ever think that they
              got there just before you did?&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp; </P>
            
            <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF"><B>Uninterruptable power supplies that
              beep for eight weeks straight and whose keepers claim they fixed
              although their network messages are still interrupting our Quake
              games:&nbsp; </B>Here's the story.&nbsp; For the last two months
              or so, the server's UPS has been beeping at least once a day for
              anywhere from 30 seconds to, say, 3 minutes at a time.&nbsp; Think
              of your alarm clock:&nbsp; loud, insistent, annoying.&nbsp; That
              wasn't so bad, despite the fact that obviously the sound wasn't
              accomplishing it's designed function of warning the MIS department
              that it needed attention.&nbsp; But recently, Deslock 'fixed' it
              (probably by saying some mystical MIS spell, such as &quot;Oh,
              yes, that'll be fixed next week at the latest.&quot;).&nbsp;
              Nevertheless, the very next day or so, the UPS not only beeps for
              a minute or so, but it suddenly chooses to begin sending out
              messages over the network to any Windows '98 computer at the exact
              moment that Chzdanish and Predator are running away from some
              asshole with a railgun (most likely Deslock, who, conveniently,
              was playing from home and therefore was not affected by the UPS's
              hissy fit).&nbsp; Quake promptly folded up and fainted, causing
              Chzdanish to write this rant.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp; </P>

            you leave in the game's messages about Chzdanish).&nbsp; The
            question is this:&nbsp; has Quake's ability to allow the user to
            bind keys to phrases like 'Mo fo' really enhanced the game for
            anyone (beyond The Dud and B-Train)?&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

              Approximately).&nbsp; Let us imagine for a moment that
              [UMTS]Deslock, in his capacity of MIS Manager, is interviewing one
              of these people for an open position in his department.&nbsp;
              Applying for the job is The Dude.&nbsp; Deslock is conducting the
              interview with The Dude while they are both connected to a Quake
              server (if you knew Deslock, you would know that such an idea is
              not entirely unrealistic).&nbsp; I imagine the interview would go
