        <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">Our favorite Quake II server is alot
          like our families.&nbsp; Warm, loving, dangerous, with a whopping
          serving of disfunctionality thrown in for good measure.&nbsp;
          <A HREF="http://www.yodasbarn.com/">Yoda's Barn</A> is all those
          things and more. Connect late at night, and you're likely to witness a
          conversation between the children, obsessed with acquaintences of
          theirs who are &quot;gay&quot;, or &quot;fags&quot;, or who play Quake
          like &quot;girls&quot;.&nbsp; At the same time, their well-meaning
          elders are attempting to enlighten them regarding their misconceptions
          by railing them out of existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
          
          <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">Visit the Barn's message board around the
            dinner hour and you might witness
            <A HREF="mailto:darkpriest@yodasbarn.com">Dark Priest</A>, the
            Barn's administrator and authoritarian father figure, actually
            threatening to physically beat Barclay into a pastey dough if he
            doesn't use the <A HREF="http://www.yodasbarn.com/bbs/">message
              board</A> according to DP's rules.&nbsp; We may whisper to each
            other later in our rooms that we &quot;hate&quot; him, but deep down
            inside, we know that he's the only father we've got...that if we
            piss him off too much, he just might kick us out of his house.&nbsp;
            It's times like this when we miss our own fathers, and each man's
            particular brand of tough love.&nbsp; And just as we now feel
            affection for our fathers, perhaps someday we will know that DP only
            made those threats because he cares about us, and not just because
            he's obsessed with important Quake players liking him.</FONT>&nbsp;
          </P>
          
          <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">And, late at night, when we're in our beds
            thinking black thoughts, we wonder whether DP will ever find for us
            the <A HREF="1divine.jpg">mommy</A> we never had.&nbsp; We silently
            plead with him to stop working so hard, and start smelling the
            roses.&nbsp; If that would only happen, we tell ourselves, then
            maybe...just maybe...he'd stop threatening to beat us to a pulp
            whenever we clog the toilet.</FONT>&nbsp; </P>
          
          <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">Remember, DP, it's all in good clean
            <A HREF="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?db=*&term=fun">fun</A>.&nbsp;
