      search for meaning.&nbsp; They say that humans are uniquely suited to
      finding patterns, purposes and higher meanings in everyday events and
      objects.&nbsp; Since ancient times, man has struggled with a strange,
      beautiful and cruel world.&nbsp; Why was Grod struck by lightening, just
      when he was about to bed the beautifully hairy Frooga? What compelled Noah
      to build a large boat in which he would float around for a month or so
      while all his friends drowned?&nbsp; I mean, it'd take a pretty damn
      compelling presentation for God to get me to live for 40 rainy days and
      nights with a bunch of smelly, and probably somewhat ill-mannered animals.&nbsp;

          way,&nbsp; we'd be admired and filthy rich to boot.&nbsp; And we'd

          you think about it, that'd be a real pain in the ass--trying to keep
          all our babes happy, making sure the butler wasn't pilfering from
          petty cash, ensuring that the chauffeur was keeping our cars polished
          and shiny, and worrying about the age of our cognac.&nbsp; And don't
          forget--to get all that crap you need to spend at least a couple hours
          a week being productive.&nbsp; Personally, I'll stick to my
          girlfriend, her piece of shit car, doing my own grocery shopping, and
          dollar drafts of Genny Cream at Hugo's.&nbsp; And keeping up my Quake
