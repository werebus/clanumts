        <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">I remember when I was a boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          My little brother and I were taunting each other.&nbsp; You know,&nbsp;
          like &quot;Is that your face or did your neck throw up?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Well, little brother went a step too far, and I judged that it would
          be best if I pushed him through a nearby plate glass storm door.&nbsp;
          Unfortunately, my plan didn't work, as it turns out that plate glass
          is surprisingly strong.&nbsp; Even more unfortunately, my mother heard
          the racket my brother made as he riccocheted off the glass, and every
          kid in the neighborhood soon received an object lesson on why it's not
          a good idea to attempt to push your little brother through a window.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF"></FONT>
          
          <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">Ever since then, I've been a pacifist.&nbsp;
            Growing up in the seventies, I was subjected to mind controling
            influences from organizations like The Brady Bunch, Sesame Street,
            and Dan Fogelburg (in the late eighties, rumors circulated in the
            underground that Mr. Fogelburg was connected with a certain
            Aisian-subcontinental government, and that it was he who emasculated
            US men with the introduction of the minivan).&nbsp; Millions of
            people were under their spell, and by the eightees their sadistic
            urges had transmuted into such pseudo-aggressive activities as the
            hostile corporate takeover, Van Halen,&nbsp; and lasertag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF"></FONT>

          <P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">Thank god, then, for the nineties when
            those urges broke free, giving us Gangsta Rap and Mortal Kombat.&nbsp;
            Suddenly, it was acceptable to bust a cap in someone's ass.&nbsp;
            Children were encouraged to carry nine mils to school, and adults
            were urged to solve their problems with the high-speed liberal
            application of lead.&nbsp; From there, it was only natural that
            Quake I and Quake II would capture the imagination of a generation
            that had had their hunter instincts clobbered into dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF"></FONT>
