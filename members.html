to be rich beyond my wildest dreams because they came up with a game controller
that runs on brainwaves?</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#33CCFF">So, I, Chzdanish, have decided that if I can't
be good at Quake, at least I can make the rules here.&nbsp; And the first

studies (which he calls his "decade of excellence", and which everyone
else calls "fucking off"), Adam has found his place at UMass Transit as
the Acting Manager of Information Systems.&nbsp; This, as we have found
out, is a sophisticated euphemism for "the guy who forgets to replace the
batteries in the 'uninterruptable' power supply."&nbsp; Oddly enough, as
Deslock, Adam shows his real prowess with information systems;&nbsp; when
Quake doesn't run properly for any reason, it is fixed through a combination
of native intelligence, tenacity and hard work.</FONT></TD>

sitting in your favorte chair playing Quake, when from out of the sky comes

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>BIOGRAPHY</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Former truck driver
for the Army, at some point L.J. decided that he had a neuron or two, and
decided to come to college and become UMTS Operations Supervisor.&nbsp;
Now fully rehabilitated from his days as a double-clutching trained killer,
Predator has replaced aggression with paintball and Quake.&nbsp; He also
regularly tries to pick up his boss and coworkers, and throw them against
the wall, thus proving that you can take the boy out of the Army, but you
can't take the Army out of the boy.&nbsp; His ability to bore you with
talk of various paintball weapons is legendary, second only to his ability
to eat foods that would render a dog insensate.&nbsp;</FONT></TD>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>BIOGRAPHY</B>:&nbsp; Consumed with thoughts
of growing old, Dave has resolved to deal with the problem by working at
UMTS, where he can surround himself with eighteen-to-twenty-two-year-olds.&nbsp;
Recently, while the members of the MTV demographic who work at UMTS were
trying to figure out how to get Chzdanish to leave his Staff position,
he outsmarted them all by getting himself a cushy full-time staff position,
"Coordinator" of safety and training.&nbsp; HAH!&nbsp; They'll never get
him to leave, now!&nbsp; AAHHH HA HA HA HA HA!&nbsp; Of course, he is overlooking
with a fervor bordering on religious the fact&nbsp; that it's just a temporary
posting until they can find someone who is actually qualified for the position.&nbsp;
However, Dave figures he can convince the right people to let him stay
by exhibiting his native intelligence, emphasizing his organizational skills,
and by welding his office door shut and epoxying himself to his chair.&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
